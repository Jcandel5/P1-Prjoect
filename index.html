        <h3>I grew up in Highlands Ranch Colorado and graduated from Highlands Ranch Highschool in 2016. I was a four time varsity wrestler and baseball player. I have always been very energetic, enthuastic when it comes to dealing with computer. I actually took all of the computer science classes my highschool had and then created one with the help of a teacher (game coding); which let you test a bunch of games than make your own. Because we only had so much time while in class and didn't have the ability to take the work home to continue working on. We could only make a tower defense game with waves of enemies that slowly got harder and had cheat codes. When I graduated from highschool I had this dead-set goal to get a four year degree in business so I went to the University of Wyoming. After about a year and a half, I relized that this wasn't the field that I was as enthuastic as I was before; so I changed my degree and went to a differnet field. The reason I chose to move back to Colorado is due to the amazing community and willingness to better eachother. While at the University I took a web design class that sparked my interest and reinforced my need to move. Although the teachers were very helpful the students were very roclusive and un-willng to help eachother to better eachother. I remember this one moment when I was sitting in class working with my group of class mates I was assigned when we were creating a website and everyonbe in my group wouldn't let me see what they had done to get a better idea of what people were doing; becuse they though I ws going to take their code and then get a better grade than them. I just laughed because I had helped this person multiple times before in this class but now they dont want to help me...okay. I really do like the community that colorado has and isn't something i will ever take for granted again. Once I returned to colorado I started to looks for coding schools and it was a descion between Galvanize and Turning and in the end I choose galvanize. When looking at the two communitys Galvanize's community is so much more open in the idea that anyone could ask a question stupid or smart and not be judged....just helped.  </h3>
